# STUDENT UTILITY APP

## Project Description
The Student Utility App is a Java console-based application designed to perform basic utility operations using a menu-driven system.
The program presents a menu with different options and allows the user to repeatedly perform operations until they choose to exit.
The application demonstrates the use of:
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Java syntax and structure
- Variables & data types
- Operators
- Decision-making (if, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Methods
- Input handling using Scanner

The program continues running until the user selects the Exit option.

## Features

The application provides the following functionalities:
1. Addition of Two Numbers
    - Prompts the user to enter two numbers 
    - Displays their sum

2. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
   - Accepts a number from the user 
   - Determines whether it is EVEN or ODD 
   - Implemented using a separate method:
   > checkEvenOrdOdd(int number)

3. Print Numbers from 1 to N
   - Accepts a value N 
   - Prints numbers from 1 up to N 
   - Implemented using a separate method:
   > print1toN(int N)

4. Display Day of the Week
   - Accepts a number from 1 to 7 
   - Displays the corresponding day 
   - Implemented using a separate method:
   > checkDay(int day)

5. Exit
   - Terminates the program

## How to run the program
1. Install Java (JDK 8 or higher).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the file directory.

4. Compile the program:
```javac StudentUtilityApp.java```

5. Run the program:
